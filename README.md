# I2S-audio-experiments
this repo contains my audio experiments for a "documentation project" in my C.S degree.
the main experiments that have been created, tested and documented are:
* Internet Radio using MAX98357A
* Internet Radio using PCM5102A
* Play an audio file from SPIFFS (internal memory of the ESP32) using MAX98357A
* Play an audio file from SPIFFS (internal memory of the ESP32) using PCM5102A
* Audio Mixing using MAX98357A
* Play audio in mono or stereo using MAX98357A or PCM5102A
  
each experiment contains the following:
- an easy-to-follow guide with step-by-step explanation, connection diagrams and code
- a video of me doing the experiment live to demonstrate that it's working (except for the last experiment, mono\stereo)
- audio samples used in the experiment
- code files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the .zip library:

I uploaded the library that was used in most of the experiments, the "ESP32-audioI2S-master.zip"
although whenever it's required to be used, a link of the github repository was posted in the experiment's guide.

recommendation:

I recommend for the future users, especially the ones that need to use the "mixing audio" experiment, to check out the 
following site which offers a great amount of help regarding everything related to audio on esp32:
